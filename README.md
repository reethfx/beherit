## 📖 About

This system leverages cutting-edge channels and versions of software to provide you with the latest updates and features. Notably, it utilizes:

- **flake** (An experimental feature of the Nix package manager)
- **nixpkgs**: unstable
- **home-manager**: a tool for managing files and configs in your /home/<user> directory using Nix

This approach ensures that you stay on the forefront of technology, receiving the most recent software advancements promptly. 🚨 However, it's important to note that this emphasis on bleeding-edge software may impact the stability of the system.

You have the flexibility to customize these configurations according to your needs by modifying the respective configuration files.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Download and Install NixOS from the [official site](https://nixos.org/download).

2. Exectue `nix-shell -p git` follwed by `git clone https:gtihub.com/reethfx/beherit ~/.config/beherit`.

3. Coppy your clean autogenerated `hardware-configuaration.nix` on the dotfiles project executing `sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration-nix ~/beheirt/nixos/`

4. Temporarily install ripgrep and fish using the command: `nix-shell -p ripgrep fish --run fish`. You can also use classic bash and grep for the next step without installing fish and ripgrep.

5. Run the command `rg --hidden FIXME` and change/add lines to match your device, swaps, partitions, peripherals, file systems, etc. in the configuration files. 

6. Enable flakes on your current configuration. You can simply do it by editing `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and adding the following line: `nix.settings.experimental-features = ["nix-command" "flakes"];`.

7. Change your hostname to your desired on `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and rebuild.
