## üìñ About

This system leverages cutting-edge channels and versions of software to provide you with the latest updates and features. Notably, it utilizes:

- **flake** (An experimental feature of the Nix package manager)
- **nixpkgs**: unstable

This approach ensures that you stay on the forefront of technology, receiving the most recent software advancements promptly. üö® However, it's important to note that this emphasis on bleeding-edge software may impact the stability of the system.

You have the flexibility to customize these configurations according to your needs by modifying the respective configuration files.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download and Install NixOS from the [official site](https://nixos.org/download).

2. Once installed, coppy your `hardware-configuration.nix` in `./system/` 

3. Temporarily install ripgrep and fish using the command: `nix-shell -p ripgrep fish --run fish`. You can also use classic bash and grep for the next step without installing fish and ripgrep.

4. Run the command `rg --hidden FIXME` and change/add lines to match your device, swaps, partitions, peripherals, file systems, etc. in the configuration files. 

5. Also enable flake on your current configuration. You can simply do it by editing `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and adding the follow line: `nix.settings.experimental-features = ["nix-command" "flakes"];`.

6. Coppy your clean autogenerated `hardware-configuaration.nix` on the dotfiles project executing `sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration-nix ~/beheirt/nixos/`
